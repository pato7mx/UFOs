# UFO Sightings

## Overview
In this project we helped Dana to improve her dynamic webpage about UFO sightings, which contains information displayed in a table that can by filtered by date, city, state, country and shape. In order to do this it was necessary to incorporate different scripts in different languages: HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Results
In the website a table is presented with all collected data about UFO sightings. Although the information is ordered and clean, it is a lot of information, so the user can filter it by multiple criteria: Date, City, State, Country and Shape of the sighting.

Its not necessary to fill in all the blanks, since the data will be filtered only by introduced criteria. A new table will be presented with data that matches the information introduced by the user.

## Summary

Although the page is good and really intuitive, the navigation bar is practically useless in its current state, so the website can be improved by adding other tabs to the navigations bar with other type of information about UFOS, not only sightings, but maybe videos, facts, news, etc. Also, the website can have links to other UFO websites to encourage the users to dig deeper in this topic.
